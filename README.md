Hello and thank you for playing my JavaScript game!
 `._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._,'


I decided to make this game because I already had some experience in creating websites both in HTML and using Wordpress
so I wanted to challenge myself in a new way!


 `._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._,'


This is a simple 2D shoot-em-up game where your goal is to reach 100 points and win! 
Every time an enemy hits you, you lose points, and you gain points by killing enemies instead!


 `._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._,'


To control the character you use the UP and DOWN arrow keys, and you shoot by tapping SPACE. You have 60 seconds to reach a 100 points or its GAME OVER.


 `._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._.-._,'

A next version of this would include more enemy types, As well as different modes for shooting (A shotgun type attack perhaps?)
 I would also like to include particles as well as different levels with increasing difficulties.
